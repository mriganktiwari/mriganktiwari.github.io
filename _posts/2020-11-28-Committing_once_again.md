# Committing once again!



Well, it's high time I document my current feelings and thoughts.



Lately my mind has been juggling several to-dos'. I see myself as someone who has good taste about a lot of things (which obviously can be debated upon), but I have never gone more than a couple of steps further from thinking about doing something. Few examples of things I've been thinking about regularly engaging myself with are: reading & writing regularly, meditating as per the technique from Naval, getting super fast with typing, coding basics of Python, guitar basics, blogging, YouTube, and above all achieving a fit and young body.



Since I last wrote about my [running transformation](https://mriganktiwari.github.io/2020/02/20/Running-transformation.html), I finished 200 kilometres in month of March 2020. Within a couple of weeks of achieving this personal best run record I did end up hurting my lower back. And ever since, which now have been painful 8 months, I have lived with excruciating pain and stiffness in lower back. These times have shown me getting pissed off on very silly things which I feel were part contributed by this "back" trouble. Of course there were times I experienced depression feelings, making me think hard on the how my future is going to be, to what lengths am I going to miss out on the fun of life. After my ignorance and utter wastage of many months, I did join a physiotherapy session for 2 weeks now.



So for past 2 weeks, my daily sessions at physio constitutes of 30 minutes of core strengthening and balancing exercises, 8 minutes of Laser/ultrasound, IFT, and heat therapies each. These weeks have brought to me a sense of strength in the lower back, and although not more than 20% recovered, I sense that I am on right track. These sessions have also introduced me to a great world of strength training using resistance bands (about which I plan on writing and recording in more detail as soon as I am ready to do so). I plan on improving my muscle strength, maintain body weight, and optimal flexibility so as to attain same agility and power I had in earlier of my life. **Feeling is that there are high chances of becoming even better than I have ever been physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, socially**.
