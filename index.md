## Hello friends,
Welcome to my world of beginning with a lot of work until I close in on the "GAP", as described by Ira Glass.

### Things I would like to do:
1. Write regularly
2. Read and importantly re-read the stuff that I think can help me improve.
3. Build a strong and happy body.
4. Do a lot of work towards my blog that I am starting today (28 Nov, 2020).

### My inspirations:
1. Mother
2. Naval Ravikant
